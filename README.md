**Practicing Model View Controller**

This project is for practicing the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern in the context of game creation.
I'm making use of the three.js library to make the game look nice, but the main goal of this project is to
practice development in an MVC project and gain a better understanding of how an MVC project scales as it gets
more complex.
